# HighLowGame

A simple number guessing game created during my time in the TechFlex Advanced Web Development year-long program.

## Overview

HighLowGame challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. After each guess, players are told whether the correct answer is higher or lower, guiding them toward the solution. This project showcases basic game logic and a basic interactive website.

## Features

- Random number generation within a configurable range
- User guesses with feedback: "Too high", "Too low", or "Correct!"
